# MikeFive Keycap Variations

![image of the keycap variations included in this repository](/mikefive-keycaps.png)

I really liked these [keycaps](https://github.com/mikeholscher/zmk-config-mikefive/tree/main/files/custom-keycaps), so I ported the keywell versions to PG1425, Choc V1, and MX/Choc V2 in various spacings. I also added a homing bar to the middle row key for a homing version. I've also included Kailh's stock flat (and unappealing) PG14 keycaps with a divot added for homing, but they still suck and are only provided for completion's sake, or because I'm too lazy to remove them from the step files. Take your pick.

## PG1425

### Two Part Cap (for FDM printing)

This port requires some extra work to get right. The tolerances on the clips for these switches are vanishingly small, and the clips themselves are _tiny_. I wasn't able to get them to fit on the switches (and/or not to prevent the switch from returning) unless I printed them flat on the print bed. This, shockingly, does not produce a very comfortable or appealing keycap, so I decided to make them two-piece, so the tops can be printed vertically with minimal supports for an appealing digital interface. The keycap tops are meant to be superglued onto the clips. Best practice I found was to mount the clips to the switches, apply CA glue to the underside of the keycap top, and then place them on top of the clip.

### Single Cap (for MJF printing)

I wanted to see if JLC's MJF process could handle the tolerances needed for the clips without having to separate the clips from the keycap surface, so I ordered some, and they turned out pretty well. The keycap walls are either at or under the tolerances JLC requires for the method, so there can be imperfections. Buy extras if this will bother you, but otherwise they fit and worked as well as I could have hoped.

Update: I added sprued versions of the single cap for easier jlc ordering.

Credit for design goes to [Mike Holscher](https://github.com/mikeholscher), thanks for putting mikefive/mikecinq/this keycap profile out into the world!

These have been produced and tested, do what thou wilt. Don't expect support beyond a silent, empathetic, but also awkward hug if these keycaps burn down your house or something.
